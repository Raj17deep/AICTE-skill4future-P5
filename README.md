# AICTE-skill4future-P5

## Overview

This project aims to predict greenhouse gas emissions by various industrial sectors using data science and machine learning techniques. It is part of the AICTE Skill4Future initiative and is organized in a week-wise structure to guide users through the progression of the project.

## Repository Structure

- `week 1 task.ipynb`:  
  This Jupyter notebook contains the tasks, code, and analysis for the first week. It likely covers initial data exploration, preprocessing, and basic modeling or insights related to greenhouse gas emissions.

- `Week 2/`:  
  This folder is designated for the second weekâ€™s work. It may include additional notebooks, scripts, or data files related to further analysis, modeling, or evaluation. (Please see the folder for detailed contents.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Common data science libraries:  
  `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, etc.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Raj17deep/AICTE-skill4future-P5.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```sh
   cd AICTE-skill4future-P5
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies (if a `requirements.txt` is present):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

- Open and run `week 1 task.ipynb` to review the initial analysis and modeling steps.
- Explore the `Week 2` directory for further progress and advanced work on the project.
