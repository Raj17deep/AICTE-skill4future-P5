# AICTE-skill4future-P5

## Overview

This project is part of the **AICTE Skill4Future initiative** and focuses on the prediction of greenhouse gas emissions produced by various industrial sectors using data science and machine learning techniques. The repository is structured to guide users through a week-wise progression, emphasizing step-by-step data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

## Repository Structure

- `week 1 task.ipynb`:  
  Jupyter notebook containing the first week's work, including:
  - Data exploration and preprocessing
  - Analysis of emission factors and data quality
  - Visualization of emissions by sector and substance
  - Initial modeling steps for predicting greenhouse gas emissions

- `Week 2/`:  
  Directory for the second week's work, which may include advanced analyses, additional modeling, or further data insights. (See the folder for specific contents.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Common data science libraries:  
  `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, etc.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Raj17deep/AICTE-skill4future-P5.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**
   ```sh
   cd AICTE-skill4future-P5
   ```
3. **Install dependencies (if `requirements.txt` exists):**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

- Open and run `week 1 task.ipynb` to explore the initial data analysis and modeling.
- Check the `Week 2` folder for more advanced work as the project progresses.
